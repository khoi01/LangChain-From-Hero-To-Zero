# 1.2 Your First Chat Call (OpenAI)

### Introduction
The most basic unit of LangChain is the `ChatModel`. We'll start with OpenAI, the industry standard for reasoning and JSON following.

### Objective
Learn how to configure and invoke an OpenAI model through LangChain and understand why this is the primary choice for "Reasoning" in Agentic systems.

### Concept
LangChain uses a standard interface for all chat models. The key parameters are:
- `model`: The specific version (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`). Use `mini` for fast, cheap tasks and `4o` for complex reasoning.
- `temperature`: How "creative" or "random" the output is. For RAG and Agents, we usually use `0` to ensure consistency.
- `api_key`: Loaded securely from your `.env` file to prevent leaking credentials in notebooks.

### Example
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv() 

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
response = llm.invoke("What are the key components of a RAG system?")
print(response.content)
```

### 2 Use Cases
1. **Quick Q&A Bot:** A simple script that answers user questions with high reliability.
2. **Content Summarization:** Passing a long block of text to the model to get a concise 3-bullet summary.

### Real-World RAG & Agentic Context
In **Real-World RAG**, OpenAI models (especially GPT-4o) are often used as the "Judge" or "Summarizer". Because they have high reasoning capabilities, they are better at synthesis—combining multiple retrieved chunks into a single, coherent answer without hallucinating.
In **Agentic Systems**, these models serve as the "Controller". An agent needs to decide which tool to use next. A model like `gpt-4o-mini` is perfect for fast sub-tasks (like formatting a search query), while `gpt-4o` is used for high-level planning and final quality checks.

### Did you know?
LangChain handles "Streaming" out of the box. In production RAG, you don't want the user to wait 30 seconds for the whole answer. You can use `llm.stream()` to show the text to the user as it's being generated, which is a critical UX requirement for modern AI apps.
