# 0.0 Getting Started: The Journey from Hero to Zero

### Introduction
Welcome to the LangChain Learning Roadmap. This series is designed to take you from knowing nothing about LangChain to building production-ready, agentic RAG systems. We use a hands-on approach, utilizing Docker and JupyterLab to ensure a consistent development environment.

### Objective
To set the foundation for your learning journey and ensure your environment is ready for the modules ahead.

### Concept
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies the process of "chaining" different components together—like prompts, models, and data sources—to create complex workflows. Instead of writing boilerplate code for every provider, LangChain provides a unified interface.

### Example
Think of LangChain like LEGO for AI. You have blocks for:
- **Models:** OpenAI, Azure, Ollama.
- **Data:** PDFs, Websites, Databases.
- **Logic:** Decisions, loops, transformations.
You don't build the plastic; you build the castle.

### 2 Use Cases
1. **Chatting with Documentation:** Building a bot that answers questions based on your company's internal PDF files.
2. **Automated Report Generation:** A system that fetches latest news, summarizes it, and formats it into a JSON report for a dashboard.

### Did you know?
LangChain isn't just for Python. It also has a robust JavaScript/TypeScript version (LangChain.js) and is increasingly being used to orchestrate "multi-agent" systems where different AI agents talk to each other to solve a goal.
