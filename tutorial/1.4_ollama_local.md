# 1.4 Local LLMs (Ollama)

### Introduction
Running LLMs on your own hardware is a game-changer for privacy, zero-cost experimentation, and offline development. Ollama simplifies this by providing a local API that LangChain can interact with.

### Objective
Learn how to connect LangChain to a local Ollama instance and understand the role of "Small Language Models" (SLMs) in a modern AI stack.

### Concept
Ollama acts as a local model host. 
- **Privacy:** Your data never leaves your RAM/GPU.
- **Latency:** No network overhead for API calls.
- **SLMs:** Smaller models (like Phi-3 or Llama-3-8B) that are "good enough" for many specific sub-tasks.

### Example
```python
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama

# Connect to a local Llama 3 model
llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3", temperature=0)
llm.invoke("What are the advantages of local LLM orchestration?")
```

### 2 Use Cases
1. **Confidential RAG:** Building a "Chat with my Documents" app for a law firm where data can never leave the premises.
2. **Speed-First Agents:** Using a tiny, fast local model to perform basic tasks like "Detect if this input is spam" before sending complex tasks to a larger model.

### Real-World RAG & Agentic Context
In **Real-World RAG**, local models are often used for **Data Pre-processing**. Before you even put your documents into a vector database, you can use a local model to "summarize" or "extract metadata" from thousands of pages for $0 API cost.
In **Agentic Systems**, Ollama is perfect for **local testing of agent loops**. Agents can run into infinite loops if not guarded properly; testing these loops locally saves you from accidental massive OpenAI bills. Additionally, "Router" agents (deciding which way to go) can often be handled by 7B or 8B models locally with high accuracy.

### Did you know?
You can run different models for different steps. For example, use a local Ollama model for **retrieval filtering** (filtering out bad RAG results) and use a powerful cloud model for the **final answer generation**. LangChain makes this "hybrid" approach seamless.
