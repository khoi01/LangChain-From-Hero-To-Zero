# 1.3 Azure OpenAI (Enterprise Reality)

### Introduction
In enterprise settings, most production RAG systems run on Azure OpenAI. It provides the same intelligence as OpenAI but with strictly defined security borders and data privacy agreements.

### Objective
Learn how to use `AzureChatOpenAI` and understand why this is a non-negotiable step for many "Production-Ready" RAG systems.

### Concept
Azure OpenAI separation of concerns:
- **Deployments:** You create a specific deployment of a model (e.g., `gpt-4o`). You map your LangChain code to this *deployment name*, not the model name.
- **Data Residency:** Your data never leaves your Azure tenant, which is critical for GDPR and HIPAA compliance.
- **API Versions:** Azure requires specific API versions, allowing you to lock in stability for your Agentic loops.

### Example
```python
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI

llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
    azure_deployment="my-rag-deployment",
    api_version="2024-02-01",
    temperature=0
)
llm.invoke("Summarize the enterprise benefits of RAG.")
```

### 2 Use Cases
1. **Government Applications:** Ensuring all AI processing happens within a specific geographic region.
2. **Medical Analysis:** Processing patient data securely using HIPAA-compliant endpoints.

### Real-World RAG & Agentic Context
In **Real-World RAG**, Azure is the standard because of its "Private Endpoints". This allows your RAG metadata and retrieved document chunks to travel across your internal network without ever touching the public internet.
In **Agentic Systems**, Azure's "Provisioned Throughput" (PTU) is vital. Agents are "chatty"—they might make 10 LLM calls for a single user query. If you use public APIs, you might hit rate limits. Azure PTU guarantees the capacity for your agents to finish their multi-step reasoning without interruption.

### Did you know?
LangChain makes it trivial to switch between Azure and public OpenAI. In a real-world project, developers often use public OpenAI for rapid prototyping (due to easier setup) and then switch to Azure for the final production deployment by just swapping the class name and environment variables.
